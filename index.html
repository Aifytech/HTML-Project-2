            <dd>
              Bite-sized finger foods are called canape appetizers. These can be hot or cold, but typically have a base and a spread with a topping or garnish. Small pieces of bread or biscuits are common canape appetizers you will be offered.

            <dd>
              A big salmon fillet always feels like a festive main course, especially when it's cooked on a cedar grilling plank, so it picks up a whisper of smoky flavor. Kick off your seafood-themed dinner party with grilled oysters and pair the fish with a simple tomato salad.

            <dt>Braised Chicken With Grapes and Fennel:</dt>
            <dd>
              There's nothing wrong with defaulting to chicken when you're trying to think of dinner party ideas. The key is to select a truly special chicken recipe, like this easy sweet-and-spicy braise, made with ribbons of fennel and juicy table grapes. You'll want to have a loaf of bread on the side for sopping up the sauce.
